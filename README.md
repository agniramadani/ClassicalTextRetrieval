Classical text retrieval focuses on basic methods like Boolean models and brute-force searches to find relevant information. While modern techniques have advanced, these foundational approaches still play a key role in information retrieval today.

## Text Processing

To process text for retrieval, we follow these steps:

- **Doc**:  Start with the raw text document.

- **Cleanse**: Remove irrelevant information like formatting, special characters, and stop words.

- **Tokenize**: Split text into individual words or tokens.

- **Tag**: Assign part-of-speech tags to each token (e.g., noun, verb).

- **Lemmatize**: Reduce words to their base or root form (e.g., "running" to "run").

- **Summarize (Vocabulary)**: Create a summary or vocabulary list of the significant words.

## Overview

We explore different classical text retrieval methods, evaluating their strengths and limitations. The goal is to understand how these foundational approaches perform in various scenarios.
